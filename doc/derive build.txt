ember new derive
cd derive
ember serve

ROUTE
ember generate route derive # url http://localhost:4200/derive

    app/routes/derive.js: This file controls the route.
    app/templates/derive.hbs: A Handlebars template that defines the content that will appear at the named URL.
    tests/unit/routes/derive-test.js : A test file where you can define a test for the functionality at your route.

Generating an application route:
ember generate route application

    [?] Overwrite app/templates/application.hbs? Yes, overwrite
      create app/routes/application.js
      overwrite app/templates/application.hbs
    installing
      create tests/unit/routes/application-test.js

=> now application.hbs only contans {{outlet}}

Making the application route redirect to the clock route:
open app/routes/application.js file and update the contents like so:

    import Ember from 'ember';

    export default Ember.Route.extend({
	redirect: function() {
	    this.transitionTo('derive');
	}
    });
    
=> url can now just be http://localhost:4200
